                  Maintaining health when healthcare and insurance remain
                  confusing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Addressing the tangled web of our U.S. healthcare system is
                  essential for holistic wellness. If you or someone you know
                  has anything less than “amazing” health insurance then you
                  know healthcare is a tough topic.
                </p>
                <strong>Here are some top complaints:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Confusing to navigate</li>
                  <li>Expensive monthly premiums</li>

                  Your average American adult over 25 years old will mention at
                  least one of the complaints listed above. If your company
                  provides health insurance then you may not notice the expense,
                  but you may experience feeling confused on which doctors are
                  in-network or how much you can expect to pay after your
                  appointment. We have all heard the news lately about large
                  bills arriving post-procedure (aka “Surprise Bills”) of
                  hundreds to thousands of dollars. I think we can all agree
                  that healthcare should not agitate more health problems.

                  <br />
                  The issues mentioned above are attributed to political and
                  social policies which oftentimes moves slower than technology.
                  In the meantime, what to do about the tangled web that not
                  only confuses you and me, but also stumps doctors and other
                  medical staff? MediXall (referred to as
                  <strong>the company </strong> from here on) originally hired
                  me for a separate more tame project. Eventually the company
                  pivoted its focus and this project landed in my lap.

                  The company was a small startup of less than 10 people at the
                  time. Three of those team members were developers and their
                  sole designer (moi!) made up the dev and design team. As lead
                  product designer, I was responsible for turning business needs
                  and consumer pain points into solutions, wireframes, and a
                  prototype.

                  The business defined our audience as “everyone” because their
                  vision is to solve healthcare for every need and demographic.
                  Short of ambitious this was a lot to consider as their
                  designer. Therefore, I strategized and thought logically about
                  our most likely consumer. <br />
                  <br />
                  Considering our product is digital, it relies on knowledge of
                  using a smartphone, requires trust in technology, and would
                  provide value for people with insurance then I anticipated our
                  potential audience would be the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ages: 26 - 45</li>
                  <li>Technologically inclined</li>

                  <li>Low to Mid Income</li>
                  <li>Frequent healthcare consumers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These types of users are more likely to consider breaking the
                  paradigm of booking and completing healthcare services. We
                  know from our surveys that people often discover new doctors
                  through referrals from family, friends, and current medical
                  professionals. Contrary to that trend, Zocdoc’s search
                  platform has contributed to breaking that paradigm paving the
                  way for future companies that rely on online searches and
                  reviews.

                  </li>
                  <li>Studying health insurance plans</li>

                  My research was motivated by my own confusion, fear, and lack

                  on a dev team that was relying on me to produce and a business

                  time in the deadline to test this prototype thoroughly. I took
                  all of the resources from my research, narrowed down some
                  hypothetical pain points, and put on my "magic" cap. This led
                  to the first iteration which to no surprise had a design
                  overhaul in later stages of the process.

                  When the opportunity presents itself, I intentionally design
                  for people with attention challenges. Therefore, I utilized
                  card design so that bits of information could be well grouped,
                  easy to read with primary focus on each scroll. I also
                  designed mobile-first and stood my ground on this decision as
                  an industry standard. The objective of this first iteration
                  was to assess the value of educating consumers. Within that
                  objective, I wished to explore pain points of real people in
                  real time and collect my own data on features that consumers
                  want in healthcare products.

                  My test users expressed satisfaction with the concept of the
                  product. They liked the efforts made to help them understand
                  where they stood financially in their insurance plan like
                  their deductible and previous appointments and spending. On
                  the downside my cards, tone of copy, and onboarding approach
                  did not translate. Again, I was not surprised by this and

                  Everytime you schedule appointments with health care

                  person. We solved that issue by creating a digital card. I
                  purposely divided the card up into relative sections to reduce

                  Analysis of user tests data made clear the strong value of
                  integrating a cost estimator that would address pain points of
                  real people. Therefore, the key feature I focused on to set
                  the product apart was to give users fee information prior to
                  their visit with the doctor. Imagine knowing ahead of time
                  that the office fee and copay add up to $X.XX and your
                  insurance company will cover the rest. Users would obtain
                  financial details without a phone call to the provider or
                  awkward silences as they fubmle through instuance card
                  details. Instead, users enter their insurance details on the
                  website, search for a preferred provider, and get feedback
                  that they can compare and scan at their leisure.

              </figure>
              <p class="column-4">
                What I learned from doing research is that most insurance plans
                have at least three different states:
              </p>
              <ul class="column-4">
                <li>Pre-deductible</li>
                <li>Post-deductible/Pre-Out-of-pocket-max(OOP)</li>
                <li>Post-Out-of-pocket-max(OOP)</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="column-4">
                Each state represents a scenario with more or less limitations
                and financial burden. The most financial weight on the user is
                the first state and the least burden is in the last state where
                the insurance company covers all medical costs except for the
                monthly premium.
                <br />
                <br />
                No doubt this is all valuable information for all parties
                involved, but as I dug deeper I noticed something very
                disturbing. In order for our users to maximize shared costs and
                support from their insurance company they would have to be
                incredibly unwell. Individuals who have maxed out a high OOP
                (e.g. $10,000) must have received a lot of medical services like
                surgery, long-term treatments, or some other serious condition.
                Let’s not forget we are talking about people’s real lives and
                their well being. Reaching each of these insurance states may
                not equate to “winning” like in other markets.

                  need and in some cases most vulnerable moments. However, there
                  is more to be achieved here. Displaying visual graphs of a

                  showing increased credit scores or gaining membership points
                  for free collectibles at your favorite department store. An
                  increase in health spending often correlates with an increase
                  in health challenges. Where is the validation and
